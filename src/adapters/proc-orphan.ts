 * Double fork: a short-lived launcher (`node -e LAUNCHER`) spawns the real process detached (own session and process
 * group, the process as its leader) with stdio on fd 3, prints its pid and exits. The process is then reparented to
 * init/launchd, so nothing that kills the caller's process tree (Claude Code cleaning up a background shell) reaches it.
 * The launcher is plain JS with no imports beyond node builtins, so it starts in tens of milliseconds and cannot drift
 * from a bundle it never loads.
